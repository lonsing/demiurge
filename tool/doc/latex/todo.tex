Class \hyperlink{classEPRSynthesizer}{E\-P\-R\-Synthesizer} ]\-: At the moment we only construct the formula, and parse back the answer to the realizability question. Parsing back the implementation for the controllable signals remains to be done. (The i\-Prover page promises to release a new version with more output formats soon.)

Class \hyperlink{classLearnSynthQBFInd}{Learn\-Synth\-Q\-B\-F\-Ind} ]Turning a winning region that was computed with optimization R\-C into a circuit is not yet implemented. However, since optimization R\-C does not increase the performance in our experiments (in contrast to optimization R\-G), this is not a severe issue at the moment. We can consider optimization R\-C as experiment that did not work out well.
